\noindent \textbf{Exercise 3.1} Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field. Then $\mathbb{F}[x]$ is a commutative ring with 1. Furthermore, it is not difficult to see that division with remainder generalizes to polynomials as follows: Let $p$, $q \in \mathbb{F}[x]$ such that $q \neq0$. Then there are uniquely determined polynomials $u$, $r \in \mathbb{F}[x]$ such that
\begin{center}
$p = uq + r$, where deg $r<$ deg $q$.	
\end{center}
Moreover, let $p \in \mathbb{F}[x]$, then, for any $a \in F$, the substitution of $x$, by $a$ defines an element of $F$ which we denote by $p(a)$. The element $p(a)$ is obtained by performing the field operations once the substitution has been carried out, e.g., let $p \in \mathbb{Z}_{7}[x]$, say $p(x) = 6x^{2} + 5x + 1$. Then $p(1) = 6 + 5 + 1 = 5$.
\begin{proof}
Since every field satisfies associativity and commutativity of additive and multiplicative operations, possesses additive and multiplicative identity and inverse elements and satisfies distributivity of the multiplicative operation over addition we can say that every Field is a ring, while not all rings are fields. So the claim that if $\mathbb{F}$ is a field then $\mathbb{F}[x]$ is a ring is true.\\
Second part is what is known as \textbf{Nonmonic Polynomial Division Algorithm}. We are gonna prove now that polynomials $u$ and $r$ are in fact unique where deg $r$ $<$ deg $q$.\\
Let's say we have two polynomials that satisfy the equation:
\begin{center}
$r = p - uq$\\
$r' = p - u'q$	
\end{center}
And for them we have that $0 \leq $ deg $r\ <$ deg $q$ and $0 \leq $ deg $r'\ <$ deg $q$, since degrees can't be negative. We can subtract the equations and get:
\begin{center}
$r' - r	= q(u - u')$
\end{center}
From $r' - r	= q(u - u')$ we have that deg $(r' - r)$ = deg $q$ + deg $(u - u')$, which would imply that degree of either $r$ or $r'$ is greater than degree of $q$, which contradicts that deg $r$ $<$ deg $q$ or deg $r'$ $<$ deg $q$. This means that $u=u'$ and $r'=r$ which means that both $r$ and $u$ are unique polynomials.

\end{proof}

\noindent \textbf{Exercise 3.2} Let $p = 19$ and consider the finite group $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$. Determine the order of every element in $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$, and list all the generators of $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$.
\begin{proof}
Sadly I have no idea how to prove this at current point.
