\noindent \textbf{Exercise 3.1} Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field. Then $\mathbb{F}[x]$ is a commutative ring with 1. Furthermore, it is not difficult to see that division with remainder generalizes to polynomials as follows: Let $p$, $q \in \mathbb{F}[x]$ such that $q \neq0$. Then there are uniquely determined polynomials $u$, $r \in \mathbb{F}[x]$ such that
\begin{center}
$p = uq + r$, where deg $r<$ deg $q$.	
\end{center}
Moreover, let $p \in \mathbb{F}[x]$, then, for any $a \in F$, the substitution of $x$, by $a$ defines an element of $F$ which we denote by $p(a)$. The element $p(a)$ is obtained by performing the field operations once the substitution has been carried out, e.g., let $p \in \mathbb{Z}_{7}[x]$, say $p(x) = 6x^{2} + 5x + 1$. Then $p(1) = 6 + 5 + 1 = 5$.
\begin{proof}
Since every field satisfies associativity and commutativity of additive and multiplicative operations, possesses additive and multiplicative identity and inverse elements and satisfies distributivity of the multiplicative operation over addition we can say that every Field is a ring, while not all rings are fields. So the claim that if $\mathbb{F}$ is a field then $\mathbb{F}[x]$ is a ring is true.\\
Second part is what is known as \textbf{Nonmonic Polynomial Division Algorithm}. We are gonna prove now that polynomials $u$ and $r$ are in fact unique where deg $r$ $<$ deg $q$.\\
Let's say we have two polynomials that satisfy the equation:
\begin{center}
$r = p - uq$\\
$r' = p - u'q$	
\end{center}
And for them we have that $0 \leq $ deg $r\ <$ deg $q$ and $0 \leq $ deg $r'\ <$ deg $q$, since degrees can't be negative. We can subtract the equations and get:
\begin{center}
$r' - r	= q(u - u')$
\end{center}
From $r' - r	= q(u - u')$ we have that deg $(r' - r)$ = deg $q$ + deg $(u - u')$, which would imply that degree of either $r$ or $r'$ is greater than degree of $q$, which contradicts that deg $r$ $<$ deg $q$ or deg $r'$ $<$ deg $q$. This means that $u=u'$ and $r'=r$ which means that both $r$ and $u$ are unique polynomials.

\noindent \textbf{Exercise 3.2} Let $p = 19$ and consider the finite group $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$. Determine the order of every element in $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$, and list all the generators of $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$.
\begin{proof}
Since $p=19$ is prime, we know that order of the group is ($p$ - 1) = 18 according to \textbf{Corollary 3.2} from slide 51. Since $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$ is a finite group, every member also has finite order, according to \textbf{Theorem 3.1} from slide 2. According to \textbf{Lagrange's Theorem}\footnote{Lagrange's Theorem - https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/group/lagrange.html} order of elements in $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$ divides the order of $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$. Since the numbers that divide 18 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 18, we will check for them when we test for order.\\
Order is smallest number $n$ such that $a^n=1$, where 1 is the identity element for multiplicative group. We will now test for order of every element in $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$:\\
\begin{center}
$1^1 = 1 \implies ord(1) = 1$\\
$2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^6 = 7, 2^9 = 18, 2^{18} = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(2) = 18$\\
$3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 8, 3^6 = 7, 3^9 = 18, 3^{18} = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(3) = 18$\\
$4^1 = 4, 4^2 = 16, 4^3 = 7, 4^6 = 11, 4^9 = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(4) = 9$\\
$5^1 = 5, 5^2 = 6, 5^3 = 11, 5^6 = 7, 5^9 = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(5) = 9$\\
$6^1 = 6, 6^2 = 17, 6^3 = 7, 6^6 = 11, 6^9 = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(6) = 9$\\
$7^1 = 7, 7^2 = 11, 7^3 = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(7) = 3$\\
$8^1 = 8, 8^2 = 7, 8^3 = 18, 8^6 = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(8) = 6$\\
$9^1 = 9, 9^2 = 5, 9^3 = 7, 9^6 = 11, 9^9 = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(9) = 9$\\
$10^1 = 10, 10^2 = 5, 10^3 = 12, 10^6 = 11, 10^9 = 18, 10^{18} = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(10) = 18$\\
$11^1 = 11, 11^2 = 7, 11^3 = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(11) = 3$\\
$12^1 = 12, 12^2 = 11, 12^3 = 18, 12^6 = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(12) = 6$\\
$13^1 = 13, 13^2 = 17, 13^3 = 12, 13^6 = 11, 13^9 = 18, 13^{18} = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(13) = 18$\\
$14^1 = 14, 14^2 = 6, 14^3 = 8, 14^6 = 7, 14^9 = 18, 14^{18} = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(14) = 18$\\
$15^1 = 15, 15^2 = 16, 15^3 = 12, 15^6 = 11, 15^9 = 18, 15^{18} = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(15) = 18$\\
$16^1 = 16, 16^2 = 9, 16^3 = 11, 16^6 = 7, 16^9 = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(16) = 9$\\
$17^1 = 17, 17^2 = 4, 17^3 = 11, 17^6 = 7, 17^9 = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(17) = 9$\\
$18^1 = 18, 18^2 = 1$ mod 19 $\implies ord(18) = 2$\\
\end{center}
So in total, there is one element with order 1 (1), one element with order 2 (18), 2 elements with order 3 (7, 11), 2 elements with order 6 (8, 12), 6 elements with order 9 (4, 5, 6, 9, 16 and 17) and 6 elements with order 18 (2, 3, 10, 13, 14, 15).
According to \textbf{Theorem 3.6} on slide 40, there are $\varphi(p - 1)$ many different generators. Since up to 18 there are 6 numbers that are relatively prime to 18 (1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17), we know that there are 6 generators of $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$. We first test for 2:
\begin{center}
[2, 4, 8, 16, 13, 7, 14, 9, 18, 17, 15, 11, 3, 6, 12, 5, 10, 1]
\end{center}
 Since all the elements of $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p}$ are present, we can claim that 2 is a generator. Since we know that 2 is a generator, according to \textbf{Theorem 3.6} from slide 40, we can get other generators by raising 2 to the relatively prime numbers of 18:  $2^{5} \equiv 13$ mod 19, $2^{7} \equiv 14$ mod 19, $2^{11} \equiv 15$ mod 19, $2^{13} \equiv 3$ mod 19 and $2^{17} \equiv 10$ mod 19. So the list of generators would be: 2, 3, 10, 13, 14, 15. Which are also all the numbers with order of 18.
\end{proof}
