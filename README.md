# Theory and Practice of Algorithms Proofs
Repository meant to accompany the course Theory and Practice of Algorithms at the Hokkaido University, that I took in Summer 2020. Even though originally intended to only contain solutions and proofs given in Lectures, I have decided to expand it to lecture notes as well, which include definitions, lemmas, algorithms, theorems and corollaries written on slides, in order to have them available for future reference.

All documents were created using Texpad and TexMaker for MacOS, and .pdf documents were created using pdflatex. The repository contains only .tex files which can be used to generate .pdf documents.

## Notes About Solutions
Lectures 6, 9, 10 and 14 have no exercises stated in slides, so documents for those lectures only contain the 'Lecture Summary' section.

It is worth noting that proofs and exercise solutions are done to the best of my ability, without insight into correct solution, which means that they are not necessarily 100% correct. I do plan, however, to return and make corrections to the possibly faulty solutions, should I expand my knowledge on the topics in the future.
