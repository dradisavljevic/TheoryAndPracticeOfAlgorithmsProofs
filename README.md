# Theory and Practice of Algorithms Proofs
A repository made to keep assignments and proofs made as part of the Theory and Practice of Algorithms course at the Hokkaido University, which I took in summer 2020. The assignments are done in LaTeX using Texpad and TexMaker.

The course covers topics like rings, fields, prime numbers, modular exponentiation and many other topics in math.

Even though .tex files state solution to every exercise as a proof, not all exercises are such that they need proving, but are instead applications of some algorithms and calculation tasks that need to be performed. I used the proof tag for the purpose of making everything uniform and easily separable.

Lectures 6, 9, 10 and 14 are omitted since the slides state no explicit exercises to be completed.

Not all solutions are necessarily correct and are subject to change as I get more familiar with the topics and gain more knowledge, but may be a good reference point for reminding myself about certain topics in the future.
